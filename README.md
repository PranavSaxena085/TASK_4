# Internship Task 4 â€“ SQL Aggregate Functions and Grouping

This is my submission for **Internship Task 4**. In this task, I worked on analyzing and summarizing data using aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, and applied `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to categorize and filter results.

I used the same E-commerce product table created earlier and performed various summary operations to understand how to work with grouped and numeric data in SQL.

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did

- Created a fresh table E_COMMERCE_TASK_4
- Inserted 10 sample product records
- Applied aggregate functions:
  - SUM() on Stock and Price
  - COUNT() on Product IDs and availability
  - AVG() to find average product prices
- Used GROUP BY to:
  - Count products by category
  - Sum stock and average price per category
- Used HAVING to:
  - Filter categories based on average price or stock count
  - Show suppliers with more than one product

## ðŸ§  SQL Concepts Practiced

- `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`
- `GROUP BY` for category and supplier-based summaries
- `HAVING` to filter grouped data with conditions

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- MySQL  
- SQL Editor: MySQL Workbench / DB Browser  
- Sample database: `internship_task`

## ðŸ’¬ Message to HR / Reviewer

In this task, I practiced how to analyze and summarize tabular data using SQL's aggregate functions. The queries helped me understand how to group data and apply filters on grouped results using `HAVING`.  
This entire work is included in the attached `.sql` file as part of Task 4.

Thank you!
